  <!-- Early Beginnings -->
  <section class="history-section">
    <h3>Early Beginnings (Late 1800s – 1910s)</h3>
    <p>In 1895, just a year after the Lumière brothers’ first public film screening in France, British inventors and filmmakers began experimenting with moving pictures. Robert W. Paul is often credited as Britain's first filmmaker. In 1896, he shot what may be the UK’s first narrative film, “Incident at Waterloo Bridge”.</p>
    <p>The Brighton School, a group of early filmmakers including George Albert Smith and James Williamson, played a crucial role in developing cinematic techniques such as close-ups, editing, and special effects.</p>

        Did you know? Robert W. Paul invented Britain’s first movie camera and projector — all without any formal training in engineering or film!

  <!-- Golden Age of Silent Films -->
  <section class="history-section">
    <h3>Golden Age of British Silent Films (1920s)</h3>
    <p>After World War I, British cinema entered a period of growth. Studios like Gainsborough Pictures and British International Pictures helped establish the UK as a major player in silent filmmaking. Stars like Ivor Novello and Betty Balfour became household names.</p>

      <div class="fact-text">
        Fun fact: Gainsborough Pictures was known for its melodramas called “Gainsborough melodramas”, which were so popular they even influenced fashion trends of the 1940s.

  <!-- Sound Era & Post-War Boom -->
  <section class="history-section">
    <h3>The Sound Era & Post-War Boom (1930s–1950s)</h3>
    <p>The arrival of sound in the late 1920s revolutionized the industry. Alexander Korda founded London Films and produced internationally acclaimed works like “The Private Life of Henry VIII” (1933).</p>
    <p>During and after World War II, British cinema focused on propaganda, realism, and documentary-style storytelling. Ealing Studios rose to prominence with comedies such as “Kind Hearts and Coronets” (1949) and “The Lavender Hill Mob” (1951).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="fact-text">
        Ealing comedies like “The Lavender Hill Mob” are considered some of the best British films ever made — and many were shot on a budget smaller than today’s indie films!

  <!-- New Wave and Beyond -->
  <section class="history-section">
    <h3>New Wave and Beyond (1960s–Today)</h3>
    <p>The 1960s saw the rise of the British New Wave movement, which brought gritty realism to the screen with films like “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning” (1960) and “A Kind of Loving” (1962).</p>
    <p>Throughout the decades, British cinema continued to evolve, producing globally celebrated directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Ridley Scott, Christopher Nolan, and Danny Boyle. Iconic franchises like James Bond and Harry Potter further cemented the UK's place in global film history.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="fact-text">
        The British New Wave focused on working-class life — a bold move at the time. Many of these films were shot on location instead of studios to capture real-life authenticity.
