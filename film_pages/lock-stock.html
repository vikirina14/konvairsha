        The story centers around Eddy (Nick Moran), a talented pool player who gets involved in a high-stakes game with local gangster Harry the Hat (Dexter Fletcher). When Eddy loses £500,000 in one night, he must find the money in just one week — or face deadly consequences. What follows is a chaotic chain of events involving crooked cops, rival gangs, and two antique shotguns that everyone seems to want.
